Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
    The client is Artemis Financial.  Artemis is a consulting company that provides financial services and plans to its clients. Artemis wants to update its application and needed help
    analyzing areas where they application security could be improved or implemented. 
    
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
    I tried to take a step apporach, and break the application analysis into targeted areas.  I thought this was the most effective way to do a security analysis so that parts were not 
    missed.  Coding securly is important becuase it protects the company and sensitive client data from potential attackers.  Software security can add value to a company's well being.
    Escpecially for a financial company.  No one wants to work with a company that has a history of leaking data or exposing client information.  It todays world there are many companies
    that do what Artemis Financial does, so having a secure application can give clients the assurance that their data will be safe while working with Aretmis Financial. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    At first I thought it was going to be very difficult to go through the project and find security weak spots.  I found that the vulnerability assessment diagram was key in helping
    me break down the whole application so I could systematically review all parts to make sure proper security measures we followed. 
    
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    By using the vulnerabilty assessment diagram I was able to look at all areas of the application and complete a security assessment.  Each step of the diagram works together to create
    layers of security so that if one were to faulter there are several layers after that would ensure data is still safe. In the future, I would follow any company guidelines given 
    to make sure that an application I was working on was using proper security practices. If I couldn't find any security guidelines I would check with either a manager or IT security.
    
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    While I was coding I had to add some new dependencies to the project.  I made such to do a dependecy scan when finished to make sure I hadn't introduced any new vulnerabilites into 
    they system.  After refactoring code I also made sure to build and run the program to ensure that functionality was not lost by adding new code or dependencies. 
    
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    I really liked the vulnerability assessment diagram.  I thought this was an easy way to make sure you follow best practices when it comes to security.  I learned about dependency 
    checks which are usful, but also learning how to suppress them.  There can be a lot of noise with depencdency checks and there is already a lot to think about while coding so being 
    able to suppress false positives I found very helpful.
    
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I think the showing the report as a whole would be a great demonstration that you can not only do a security assessment, but that you can write up a report and present that
    information in a way that is usful, understandable, and actionable.  Employeers are not only looking for individuals that can code but well roundd individuals that can communicate
    their findings or research and turn those into actionable steps for the company.
